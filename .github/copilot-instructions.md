# Project-Specific Guidance â€“ Research Reproducibility

## ðŸ§ª Research Code Clarity

- Prioritize code **readability and clarity** over performance.
- Use **explicit, well-named variables** and **clear control flow**.

## ðŸ§¾ Reproducibility and Documentation

- Ensure all code is **well-documented** with in-line comments and Google-style docstrings.
- Write **comprehensive Markdown instructions** for reproducing experiments.

## ðŸ”¬ PyTorch and Python Modernity

- Use **Python 3.10+** and **PyTorch 2.1+** features idiomatically.
- Prefer built-in types and modern syntax for clarity.

## Goal

Support reproducible research with clean, understandable code and thorough documentation.
